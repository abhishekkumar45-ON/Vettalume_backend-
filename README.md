# Vettalume Backend

The unified backend for Vettalume (CAT / GMAT / GRE) — "one brain, three skins."
**Stack:** Python · FastAPI · SQLAlchemy 2.0 · PostgreSQL · (Redis wired for later phases).

This repository is being built in phases. **Phase 0 (this drop)** is the walking skeleton:
the locked data model, the bulk-ingestion QC gate, and a proven end-to-end path
(ingest items → answer → state persists).

---

## Run it

### Option A — Docker (Postgres + Redis + app)
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
Then open:
- **http://localhost:8000/docs** — interactive API (Swagger). This is your Phase-0 test surface.
- **http://localhost:8000/dashboard** — the Vettalume dashboard prototype (reference; wired up in Phase 1).

### Option B — Local, zero infra (SQLite)  ← recommended to start
Use **Python 3.9–3.13**. Do **not** use Python 3.14 yet — it's too new and several
dependencies don't ship prebuilt wheels for it, so installs try to compile from source and fail.
`psycopg2` is **not** needed here (it's Postgres-only).

```bash
# pick a Python that is NOT 3.14 (your system /usr/bin/python3 is usually fine):
/usr/bin/python3 --version
/usr/bin/python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python --version                       # sanity-check: must not say 3.14
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt        # lean: no psycopg2, nothing to compile
uvicorn app.main:app --reload          # SQLite is the default — no DATABASE_URL needed
```

Then open **http://localhost:8000/docs**. (SQLite writes to `./vettalume.db`. To use Postgres
instead, set `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://…`; Docker does this for you.)

> On macOS, if `python3` points to 3.14 (Homebrew/python.org), either use `/usr/bin/python3`
> as above, or install a stable one: `brew install python@3.12` and use `python3.12`.

---

## Test it

**Swagger (`/docs`)** is the fastest way to exercise every endpoint by hand. Typical flow:
1. `POST /auth/dev-login` with `{"email":"you@test.com"}` → copy the returned `learner_id`.
2. Click **Authorize**-style header use: pass `X-Learner-Id: <learner_id>` on the practice calls.
3. `GET /catalog/tree?exam=CAT` → see the seeded topic/concept tree.
4. `POST /ingest/items` → bulk-add questions (see schema in `/docs`).
5. `GET /practice/next?node_id=avg-simple` → get a question (answer is not returned).
6. `POST /practice/answer` → submit; correctness is graded server-side; mastery updates.
7. `GET /practice/state?exam=CAT` → see per-concept state.

**Scripted demo** (against a running server):
```bash
python scripts/demo_flow.py
```

**Automated smoke test** (in-memory SQLite, no server needed):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q
```

---

## Bulk upload — the authoring template (primary path)

`POST /ingest/question-bank/xlsx` accepts the **Vettalume question-bank template**
(`Vettalume_Question_Bank_Template.xlsx`). This is how authors add questions. One sheet does
three things at once:

1. **Builds the knowledge graph** from the `Topic` / `Subtopic` columns (topics and concepts are
   reused by name, so re-importing never duplicates them).
2. **Wires prerequisites** from the `Prerequisites` column (subtopic-level — e.g. *Weighted
   Averages requires Simple Averages*). These drive concept-level unlocking (ZPD).
3. **Ingests the questions**, resolving the answer to the option value.

The whole file is atomic: a bad row rejects the batch (taxonomy included) with a per-row error list.
A *dangling* prerequisite (a name that isn't a subtopic in the file) is reported as a **warning**, not
a rejection — the question still loads, only that one edge is skipped.

### Two accepted layouts

The importer reads **both** of these, including across multiple sheets in one upload:

* **Single sheet with an `Exam` column** (`Vettalume_Question_Bank_Template.xlsx`).
* **One sheet per exam** (`Vettalume_Question_Bank_by_Exam.xlsx`) — the **tab name is the exam**
  (CAT / GMAT / GRE), no `Exam` column needed. All tabs ingest in one atomic transaction.

It also handles the richer answer shapes automatically — the stored **format is derived from the
answer**, not from a label:

| In the sheet | Stored as |
|---|---|
| up to **5 options** (`Option A`–`Option E`) + a single letter | `mcq`, letter resolved to its value |
| **multiple letters** (`A, C` — e.g. Sentence Equivalence) | `tita`, the chosen option **values** joined |
| a **sequence / typed answer** with no options (`SPRQ`) | `tita`, the literal answer |
| `Question type` (Problem Solving, Data Sufficiency, Parajumble…) | kept on the item as `archetype_id` |


### What you author vs what the engine calculates later

| Tag (sheet column) | Who fills it |
|---|---|
| `Question ID`, `Exam`, `Section`, `Topic`, `Subtopic` | **author** |
| `Prerequisites` (subtopic names, or `-`) | **author** — becomes the prerequisite DAG |
| `Difficulty (-2 to 2)` | **author** — expert prior; also the seed for `IRT b` |
| `Question format` (`MCQ`/`TITA`), `Question text`, `Option A–D` | **author** |
| `Correct answer` (`A`/`B`/`C`/`D`, or the value) | **author** |
| `Solution / explanation`, `Expected time (sec)` | **author** |
| `Passage / Set ID` (groups questions sharing a passage, or `-`) | **author** |
| `Source`, `Status` (`approved` is served; others are held) | **author** |
| `IRT b` — *and its siblings `IRT a`, `IRT c`* | **derived by calibration (Phase 2)** — left empty on import |
| mastery, MAPLE edge, exposure, empirical p-values | **computed at runtime** — never stored as tags |

The `IRT b` column may sit in the sheet as a placeholder, but the importer **ignores it on
purpose**. Difficulty is on the same −2..2 scale as `IRT b` so your expert difficulty is literally
the prior that calibration refines from real response data.

> Import into a **fresh DB** the first time. If you import on top of the demo seed, nodes that share
> a name (e.g. *Simple Averages*) are reused rather than duplicated — which is correct, just be aware.

### Programmatic / generator path

`POST /ingest/items` (JSON) and `POST /ingest/items/xlsx` remain for the generator pipeline. Same
QC gate, same `-2..2` difficulty, and the same rule: **`irt_a` / `irt_b` / `irt_c` cannot be
authored** — the schema rejects them.

---

## Testing the MAB

Three ways to drive the engine, from most automated to most hands-on.

### 1. Deterministic drive (no server, no typing) — `scripts/mab_drive.py`

Imports a workbook into a throwaway in-memory DB and walks one learner through the Learning loop,
answering with a **controllable accuracy** (it reads each item's correct answer from the DB), then
prints the topic/concept/mode/difficulty/✓✗/mastery/MAPLE-edge per step and a final mastery map.

```bash
# approved-only (production behaviour)
python scripts/mab_drive.py /path/to/Vettalume_Question_Bank_by_Exam.xlsx --exam CAT --steps 30 --accuracy 0.85

# include drafts too (drive over the WHOLE bank while authoring)
python scripts/mab_drive.py bank.xlsx --exam CAT --steps 60 --accuracy 0.75 --include-drafts

# always-right / always-wrong, different RNG seeds
python scripts/mab_drive.py bank.xlsx --exam GMAT --accuracy 1.0
python scripts/mab_drive.py bank.xlsx --exam CAT  --accuracy 0.5 --seed 3
```

### 2. Upload + poke the API — `/docs`

Boot the app (Option B above) and open **`/docs`**. Use **`POST /ingest/question-bank/xlsx`** to
upload the workbook, then `POST /auth/dev-login`, set the returned id as the `X-Learner-Id` header,
and call `GET /learn/next` → `POST /learn/answer` → `GET /learn/map` to step the loop by hand.

### 3. Interactive console — `/console`

Open **`/console`**. It wears the dashboard skin but is driven 100% by the real API: a Learn pane
(`/learn/next` loop with live P/D/M bars + MAPLE edge ladder), a Map pane (`/learn/map` with
locks/recommendation), and an event log of every call. Best for *seeing* the engine behave.

* **Skip** (`skip →` button): drops the current question for this session and serves a different one,
  so you're never stuck on a single item. Skipped items don't come back until you reset the learner.
  Under the hood it's `GET /learn/next?exclude=<comma-separated item ids>`; the engine walks to the
  next concept when a concept's items are all excluded.
* **Visible ZPD**: every concept in the map shows its prerequisites with *your current mastery* of
  each and the H threshold (e.g. `🔒 blocked — needs Core exponent laws 42% / need 74%`). The map
  response carries `mastery_threshold` and per-node `prereqs_detail` (`{name, mastery, met}`).

### Two runtime toggles (env vars)

| Env var | Default | Effect when flipped |
|---|---|---|
| `SERVE_ONLY_APPROVED` | `true` | `false` → serve **draft** items too (drive the MAB over the whole bank during authoring) |
| `ZPD_USE_PREREQS` | `true` | `false` → ZPD **ignores prerequisites** — nothing locks; the topic bandit picks purely on room-to-grow |

Set them on the run command (or in `.env`):

```bash
SERVE_ONLY_APPROVED=false ZPD_USE_PREREQS=false uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

> **`Status` gates what's served.** Only `approved` questions reach a learner; `draft` (and anything
> else) are held. The bandit will **not** recommend a topic/concept whose only items are drafts — so
> if a drive ends quickly, check your approved count (`--include-drafts` or `SERVE_ONLY_APPROVED=false`
> to drive over everything, or mark more rows `approved`).

---

## No-repeat selection + difficulty-ladder mastery (v0.2.9)

Two coupled selection bugs were fixed so the MAB feels right while solving:

**1. Questions no longer repeat.** The problem bandit now *hard-prefers fresh (never-answered) items*:
while any unseen item remains in a concept it will never re-serve one you've already answered. Only
once the entire fresh pool is exhausted does `next_step` fall back to **spaced review** (mode
`"review"`, least-recently-seen first) — so a repeat only ever appears as deliberate, labelled
review, never as the same question moments later.

**2. Difficulty actually climbs.** Previously one lucky correct answer "mastered" a concept, so you
saw a single mid-difficulty item per concept and never reached the hard ones. Now:
* a concept stays in rotation until it is *mastered* — `mastery ≥ H` **and** enough attempts to have
  worked up its ladder (`MASTERY_MIN_ATTEMPTS = 3`, capped at the concept's item count so a 1- or
  2-item concept is still masterable);
* the **topic** bandit likewise keeps a topic in play until its concepts are mastered, not merely
  above H;
* as you answer, the MAPLE edge moves (right → harder, wrong → easier) and the next fresh item tracks
  it, so a strong learner climbs d0 → d1 → d2 within each concept.

Prerequisite **locks are unchanged** — they still release at `mastery ≥ H` (one strong answer), so
ZPD unlocking stays fast; only *advancement through a concept's own items* now requires the ladder.

Verified against the real 42-question bank by driving the exact console flow at three skill levels:

| Learner (accuracy) | Distinct served | Fresh repeats | Difficulty spread |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strong (0.9) | 36 | **0** | −1, 0, 1, **2** |
| Mixed (0.6) | 31 | **0** | −1, 0, 1, **2** |
| Struggling (0.35) | 18 | **0** | −1, 0, 1, **2** |

Practise in `/console` (or click **↻ simulate practice** on `/chapter`): every question is different
until you've seen them all, and difficulty adapts to how you're doing.

---


## Chapter analytics — `/chapter` + `/analysis/*`

Once a learner has practised a chapter (a **topic**, e.g. *Indices and Surds*) and worked its
subtopics (the **concepts** under it), the platform exposes a full per-chapter analysis. Everything
is derived live from the append-only response spine + node states — no new tables.

**The page:** open **`/chapter?exam=CAT&topic=Indices and Surds`** (or just `/chapter` and pick from
the dropdown). It reuses the chapter design and fills every section from the API. A **↻ simulate
practice** button auto-answers ~60 questions so you can see it populated without hand-solving, and the
exam segmented control + chapter dropdown let you switch context.

**The endpoint:** `GET /analysis/chapter?exam=&topic=` (or `&topic_id=`) returns the eight blocks the
dashboard renders, all scoped to the current learner (`X-Learner-Id`):

| Block | What it is | Derived from |
|---|---|---|
| `kpis` | questions answered, topic mastery, concepts learnt / total, overall accuracy | spine count + node states |
| `difficulty_spread` | accuracy per band **D1..D5** (= authored difficulty −2..2) | responses grouped by `difficulty_d` |
| `improvement_over_time` | cumulative-correctness curve; **weekly** if activity spans ≥ 2 weeks, else a within-session **progress** curve (`unit` says which) | response timestamps |
| `learning_vs_practice` | time split — first attempt on a concept counts as *learning*, repeats as *practice* (`Hh Mm` + %) | `response_time_ms` per concept |
| `strongest` / `weakest` | top / bottom concepts by mastery | node states |
| `recommended_actions` | *Learn X next* / *Revisit Y* — same MAB the learn loop uses (`within_topic_candidates`) | bandit |
| `practice_test` | last scored mock batch in this chapter (0 until mocks exist) | spine (mock contexts) |
| `subtopics` | every concept: mastery, learned, mastered, attempts, accuracy, edge | node states + spine |

**Populate it for testing** (dev only — needs `dev_mode`, on by default):

```bash
# auto-drive the MAB for the current learner and record real responses
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8001/analysis/simulate?exam=CAT&steps=60&accuracy=0.7" \
  -H "X-Learner-Id: <your-learner-id>"

# then read the analysis
curl -s "http://localhost:8001/analysis/chapter?exam=CAT&topic=Indices%20and%20Surds" \
  -H "X-Learner-Id: <your-learner-id>" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Or simplest: open `/chapter`, click **↻ simulate practice**, watch it fill. Lower `accuracy` →
more wrong answers → more *revise* activity → richer practice-time + a more varied curve. The page
and `/console` share the same browser learner (`localStorage.vl_learner`), so practising in the
console then opening `/chapter` shows your real numbers.

---

- **Catalog:** `Exam`, `Section`.
- **Knowledge graph:** `KnowledgeNode` (tree via `parent_id`) + `PrereqEdge` (the DAG).
- **Shared item bank:** `Item` (authored fields + derived calibration fields kept separate).
- **Event spine:** `Response` — append-only, **context-aware** (`practice` / `diagnostic` /
  `sectional_mock` / `full_mock`). Only cold contexts are admissible for calibration.
- **Exposure ledger:** `Exposure` — drives the shared-bank eligibility rule (mocks strictly
  exclude seen items; practice allows repeats).
- **Mastery store:** `LearnerNodeState` (Phase-0 placeholder mastery; replaced in Phase 1).
- **Ingestion QC gate:** validate-all-then-commit, controlled-vocabulary FK checks, idempotent
  dedup, content-change versioning that invalidates calibration.
- **Auth:** Phase-0 stub (learner_id = bearer token).

## Learning engine (Phase 1)

The adaptive Learning loop — a hierarchical multi-armed bandit over the knowledge graph. Runs on
observed correctness + expert difficulty (1–5); **no IRT, no calibration**. All state is derived
from the spine; `LearnerNodeState` is a cache.

- **Mastery** (`engine.py`) = `0.40·P + 0.30·D + 0.30·M` (eq8): `P` = EWMA accuracy (β=0.8),
  `D` = difficulty-weighted accuracy, `M` = decaying memory traces with a spacing effect.
  Threshold `H = 0.74`.
- **Topic bandit + ZPD:** a topic unlocks only when every prerequisite topic is mastered; among
  unlocked, unmastered topics the engine picks the highest expected learning gain (room-to-grow ×
  momentum).
- **Problem bandit + MAPLE:** within a concept, question difficulty tracks a MAPLE "edge" (starts
  3, ±0.4 per answer, clamped 1–5); items are chosen by a Gaussian difficulty prior around the edge.
- **Memory Chain review:** mastered concepts whose memory trace decays below threshold surface for
  spaced review.

Endpoints (all need the `X-Learner-Id` header):

| method | path | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/learn/next?exam=CAT[&section=QA]` | engine's next decision: topic → learn/revise → question (+ teaching content on a new concept) |
| POST | `/learn/answer` | record an answer; returns correctness, P/D/M breakdown, mastery, edge, review status |
| GET | `/learn/map?exam=CAT[&section=QA]` | full map: topics with lock/mastery/recommended + per-concept state |
| GET | `/learn/reviews?exam=CAT` | concepts due for spaced review |
| GET | `/learn/concept/{node_id}` | per-concept analytics |

Two ways to test it:

- **Visual playground** (clickable): open **`http://localhost:8001/play`** — answer questions, watch
  mastery climb and topics unlock. A test client for the backend; your real frontend will call the
  same endpoints.
- **Simulation** (scripted): `python scripts/learning_sim.py` — prints a learner mastering
  Averages → Ratio → Mixtures (unlocking), with the P/D/M breakdown and MAPLE edge each step.

**Tuning:** all engine constants live at the top of `app/services/engine.py`. Note
`MASTERY_MIN_ATTEMPTS` (default `3` as of v0.2.9 — a concept must be worked up its difficulty ladder,
not cleared by one lucky correct; it is capped per concept at the number of items available so small
concepts stay masterable). Prerequisite *unlocking* still releases at `mastery >= H`.

---

## Psychometric IRT — scoring + calibration (Phase 2)

Phase 2 adds the mock-side psychometric engine. It is kept **strictly separate** from the Learning
side: Learning uses a blended 0–1 mastery (no IRT); **mocks** use an IRT ability `theta` on the
−3..+3 scale. Calibration reads **cold responses only** (`diagnostic`, `sectional_mock`, `full_mock`)
— practice answers are contaminated by teaching and never feed it. Authored difficulty is only a
*prior* for `b`; it never authors `a` or `c`.

**The 3PL model.** `P(correct) = c + (1 − c) / (1 + e^(−a(theta − b)))` — `b` difficulty, `a`
discrimination, `c` the guessing floor (≈ 1/options for MCQ, ≈ 0 for type-in).

**Ability (`app/services/irt.py`, `ability.py`).** Estimated by **EAP** — the mean of the posterior
belief curve over a `theta` grid (−3..+3 step 0.5) starting from a `N(0,1)` prior, so the estimate is
finite and sensible from the very first answer. Uncertainty is `SE = 1/sqrt(total information)`. A
cheap **Elo** running update (`theta += K(R − P)`) is also available. The reference's worked numbers
are pinned as tests: one correct on a `b=0` item → `theta ≈ +0.275 (SE 2.42)`, one wrong → `−0.41`,
the climb `+0.55 → +0.81 → +0.57`.

**Calibration worker (`app/services/calibration.py`).** Discovers `(a, b, c)` from the cold
right/wrong matrix:
1. **bootstrap** — ability ≈ `logit(score)`, `b ≈ −logit(item p-correct)`, `a=1`, `c=floor`;
2. **Step A** — re-estimate every learner's `theta` by EAP (items fixed), then recenter abilities to
   mean 0 / sd 1 to anchor the scale;
3. **Step B** — re-fit every item's curve by regularized (MAP) Newton-Raphson (abilities fixed);
4. loop A/B until parameters stop moving.

It is **phased**, because thin data cannot support all three parameters (the reference shows `b`
recovers at ~40 responses, `a` is weak, `c` is noise):

| Responses per item | Estimates | Fixes |
|---|---|---|
| `< two_pl_at` (default 500) | `b` only | `a=1`, `c=floor` |
| `< three_pl_at` (default 2000) | `b`, `a` (2PL) | `c=floor` |
| `>= three_pl_at` | `b`, `a`, `c` (3PL) | — |

A strong prior keeps `c` near the format floor (freely fitting it diverges and corrupts `a`/`b`), and
each Newton step is clamped — so the 3PL phase is stable rather than blowing up.

**Versioned parameter store.** Every run writes a `CalibrationRun` and one `IrtParameter` row per item
(`a, b, c, phase, n_responses`, run lineage). The row with `active=True` is live; recalibration flips
the flag, retaining history for rollback and drift checks. The active set is mirrored onto
`Item.irt_*` with a version bump. `active_params()` falls back to the authored prior when an item has
never been calibrated.

**Simulation harness = the release gate (`app/services/sim_harness.py`).** Manufactures a population
with **known** true `a, b, c`, answers the bank through the 3PL, runs the exact production calibration
loop, and reports recovery (correlations + RMSE). Calibration is only trusted once it recovers
difficulty on synthetic data. Verified recovery (60 items):

| Responses/item | Phase | `b` corr | `a` corr | `c` corr |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~40 | b-only | ~0.87 | — (fixed) | — (fixed) |
| ~600 | 2PL | ~0.98 | ~0.84 | — (fixed) |
| ~2200 | 3PL | ~0.91 | ~0.55 | ~0.66 |

`b` is recovered well throughout; `a` needs the 2PL volume; `c` is marginal even at the 3PL volume —
exactly the reference's honest finding.

### Endpoints (`/irt`, dev where noted)

| Method · path | What |
|---|---|
| `POST /irt/simulate?students=&items=&seed=&b_min=` | **dev** — run the gate; returns recovery + pass/fail |
| `POST /irt/calibrate?exam=&two_pl_at=&three_pl_at=&activate=` | **dev** — calibrate cold responses, write a versioned set |
| `GET /irt/runs?exam=` · `GET /irt/runs/{id}` | calibration history; run detail with per-item params |
| `GET /irt/item/{item_id}` | active `(a,b,c)` + source (`calibrated`/`authored_prior`) + full history |
| `POST /irt/score?exam=&scope=&session_id=&method=` | score the current learner's cold/mock answers → `theta` ± SE |
| `GET /irt/ability?exam=` | the learner's latest stored `theta` |

**Try it.** The gate needs no data: `POST /irt/simulate` → see `b_corr` and `gate.passed`. To
calibrate real data you first need cold responses (diagnostic/mock context); with the current sparse
bank everything stays in the honest **b-only** phase. `c` only unlocks around ~2000 responses/item.

### Run an IRT mock and watch theta move (`scripts/irt_mock.py`)

An interactive adaptive mock that prints the ability estimate after every answer — the quickest way to
see IRT working. It serves the highest-information question at your current ability (a real CAT move),
records each answer in the cold `full_mock` context, and re-estimates `theta` by EAP (−3..+3) with its
SE and 95% interval. No server needed; each run is a fresh session from `theta = 0`.

```
python scripts/irt_mock.py PATH_TO_BANK.xlsx --exam GMAT
python scripts/irt_mock.py PATH_TO_BANK.xlsx --exam GMAT --section Quant --max 20
```

If no path is given it looks for `~/Downloads/Vettalume_Question_Bank_by_CAT_GMAT.xlsx`. Items are
uncalibrated, so `b` is the authored difficulty, `c` the option floor, `a = 1` — exactly how a
cold-start diagnostic scores before calibration. Answer correctly and `theta` climbs while the engine
serves harder questions; struggle and it falls and serves easier ones, with SE shrinking as evidence
accumulates.

## Mocks — delivery engines + scoring adapters (Phase 3)

Phase 3 turns the IRT core into an actual mock product: three delivery engines and three scoring
adapters on one psychometric core, with exposure control and a per-response durability checkpoint —
the split is straight from the PRD (one engine and one adapter per exam).

**Delivery engines (`app/services/mock_delivery.py`).** A shared next-item interface, three engines:
* `item_adaptive` (GMAT) — continuous max-information selection at the current `theta`, exposure
  applied first;
* `mst` (GRE) — a fixed routing module, then route by interim `theta` into an easy / medium / hard
  panel assembled by difficulty band;
* `fixed_form` (CAT) — a pre-assembled balanced linear form, served in order, no adaptivity.

All three read the active calibrated `(a,b,c)` (falling back to the authored prior) and never re-serve
within a session or across a learner's earlier mocks.

**Exposure control.** `exposure_counts()` tracks how often each item has been served across the whole
population; selection applies an optional exposure cap and then randomesque-picks among the top-K most
informative items weighted toward the less-exposed — the IRT doc's "exposure limits before maximum
information". `GET /mock/exposure/report` surfaces the most-served items.

**Scoring adapters (`app/services/mock_scoring.py`).** The core emits a `theta`+SE (overall and
per-section); each adapter maps it to its exam's scale:
* `composite` (GMAT) — 205–805 total + 60–90 section scores;
* `sectional` (GRE) — per-section 130–170 + the panel taken (essay 0–6 scored separately);
* `percentile_call` (CAT) — `theta` → percentile (normal-CDF norm) → per-institute **call
  probability** = `P(true percentile ≥ cutoff)` from `theta ± SE`, with a confident-yes / confident-no
  / too-close-to-call read off the SE band.

**Per-response reliability checkpoint (`MockSession` + `app/services/mock_session.py`).** The
`MockSession` row is committed after **every** answer with the running `theta`, SE, marginal
reliability (`rho = 1 − SE²`), delivery cursor, and served list — so a dropped connection loses
nothing; `GET /mock/{sid}` resumes from exactly that state. Item-adaptive mocks stop on the SE target
(`se_target`, default 0.30 — "precise enough") or `max_items`. Mock responses are recorded in a cold
mock context (feeding IRT/calibration) and **never touch the Learning-side 0..1 mastery** — that
separation is now enforced in `concept_attempts` (practice-context only).

### Endpoints (`/mock`)

| Method · path | What |
|---|---|
| `POST /mock/start?exam=&mode=&section=&max_items=&se_target=` | begin a mock (`mode` = item_adaptive / mst / fixed_form); returns the first question |
| `GET /mock/{sid}/next` | next question per the engine (or the final score when complete) |
| `POST /mock/{sid}/answer` `{item_id, answer_given}` | grade, recompute `theta`/SE/reliability, advance, checkpoint |
| `GET /mock/{sid}` | resume — the checkpointed state after a dropped connection |
| `GET /mock/{sid}/score` | the exam-native score (composite / sectional / percentile+call) |
| `GET /mock/exposure/report?exam=` | population exposure (most-served items) |

Each `mode` works on any exam with items spread across difficulty; with uncalibrated items the engine
uses the authored difficulty as `b`, so you can run a full mock today and recalibrate later.

## Diagnosis chassis + plan engine (Phase 4)

Phase 4 is where the platform stops *measuring* and starts *prescribing*. It classifies every miss by
**cause** (not aggregate accuracy), ranks the learner's leaks, and turns that into a prerequisite-ordered
study plan that re-plans continuously and explains each change in plain language.

Two chassis rules from the platform PRD are enforced in code:
- **Diagnose before prescribing.** With no practice signal the diagnosis returns `insufficient_data`
  and the plan engine *refuses* to plan (`status: "refused"`).
- **Gap detection in Part 1, not Part 2.** The primary diagnosis reads the **practice loop only**
  (`context == practice`). A mock is decomposed by the *same* taxonomy as a separate rendering
  (`/diagnosis/mock/{sid}`), never folded into the practice diagnosis. (This keeps the three estimators
  — 0..1 learning mastery, IRT theta, and diagnosis — strictly separate, as in Phases 1–3.)

### The cause taxonomy (4 shared + 2 exam-native)

| Cause | Bucket | Fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `concept_gap` | foundations | needed a hint and still missed, a prerequisite is unmet, or concept mastery is below threshold |
| `process_error` | execution | concept is held, normal time — the rule is held but the procedure broke |
| `timing_pressure` | execution | concept is held, response time over the slow threshold (accuracy collapses under pace) |
| `careless_slip` | execution | concept is held, very fast answer on an easy item (capability present, lapse) |
| `vocabulary_gap` | vocabulary | **GRE** only, on a vocabulary item — remediated by the vocab engine, not reasoning practice |
| `selection_error` | selection | **CAT** only, a snap attempt on a hard item under negative marking (should have been skipped) |

Each node carries a **cause mixture** (the fraction of its misses by cause) and a **dominant cause**.
The headline **strategy decomposition** rolls all misses into foundations / execution / selection /
vocabulary — *decompose strategy instead of reporting aggregates*.

### Leak ranking (recency-weighted)

A leak's score sums its misses, weighted by difficulty and by **recency** (`RECENCY_DECAY` per newer
attempt on the same concept). A node whose recency-weighted score falls below `LEAK_FLOOR` is treated
as **resolved** and drops out of the diagnosis and the plan — so *candidates do not repeat what is
broken*. Closing a concept (recent correct work) removes it on the next re-plan.

### Plan engine

For each top leak the plan schedules any **unmet prerequisite first** (you cannot fix Mixtures while
Ratios is broken), then the leak itself with a **cause-appropriate remediation** (concept gap ->
learn the concept; process -> drill the method; timing -> timed sets; careless -> accuracy reps;
vocabulary -> vocab engine; selection -> selection trainer). Plans are **versioned**: each re-plan
diffs against the prior active version (added / removed / reprioritized) and emits a plain-language
explanation. Ability is published as a **range** (`band_95`), never a bare point — the platform-wide
honesty contract.

### Endpoints (`/diagnosis`, `/plan`)

| Method + path | Does |
|---|---|
| `GET /diagnosis?exam=` | full diagnosis: cause mixture per node, leak ranking, strategy decomposition, honest ability range |
| `GET /diagnosis/leaks?exam=&top=` | the ranked leaks (+ decomposition) |
| `GET /diagnosis/mock/{sid}` | decompose one mock's misses by the same taxonomy (a rendering, kept separate) |
| `POST /plan/generate?exam=` | generate / re-generate the plan; refuses without signal; returns diff + explanation on a re-plan |
| `GET /plan?exam=` | the current active plan |
| `GET /plan/history?exam=` | every plan version with its change explanation |

### Honest limitations (heuristic layer)

The cause **thresholds** (`SLOW_MS`, `FAST_MS`, `EASY_D`) and the leak **decay/floor** are deliberate,
explicit heuristics — tune them on real data. `selection_error` and `vocabulary_gap` currently use
proxies (a fast attempt on a hard CAT item; a "vocab" tag on the node/section/format); they become
precise once the delivery layer captures real skip/attempt decisions and the GRE bank carries vocab
tags. The diagnosis is only as good as the practice signal feeding it.

## Analysis/debrief, review surfaces, billing, Honest Perimeter (Phase 5)

Phase 5 adds the four shared layers that sit above the engine: a mock **debrief**, **review surfaces**,
a **billing/entitlements** system, and the platform-wide **Honest Perimeter** that every prediction
must pass through.

### The Honest Perimeter (enforced, not aspirational)

Three rules live in `services/honesty.py`:
- **Ranges, not points.** Every prediction is wrapped in a 95% band (`perimeter` from a point+SE, or
  `perimeter_band` from an explicit band when the SE is not in the reported units).
- **No inflation.** A prediction with too little supporting evidence (`basis_n < MIN_BASIS_N`) is
  marked `is_claim: false` / `basis: "provisional"` — shown as an estimate to be confirmed, never as
  a claim. A 3-item mock score comes back provisional on purpose.
- **A published accuracy record.** Each emitted prediction is logged (`PredictionRecord`); once a real
  outcome is known, the band's coverage and point error are computed. `GET /honesty/accuracy` reports
  band coverage (should sit near 0.95 if the bands are honest) and mean error, and stays *unpublished*
  until enough outcomes accumulate (`PUBLISH_MIN_N`).

### Debrief + review surfaces (`/review`, `/honesty`)

| Method + path | Does |
|---|---|
| `GET /review/mock/{sid}` | full mock debrief: honest score **band**, cause decomposition (Phase-4 taxonomy), timing read, section breakdown; the item-by-item review with solutions is a **paid** surface, the free tier gets the score + counts |
| `GET /review/queue?exam=` | shared review surface: items the most recent attempt got wrong, grouped by concept with solutions, plus due spaced reviews |
| `GET /review/progress?exam=` | honest ability **trend** (each point banded), topic mastery, open leaks, and the published accuracy record |
| `GET /honesty/accuracy?exam=&kind=` | the platform's published prediction-accuracy record |

The debrief logs its headline as a `PredictionRecord`, so the accuracy record builds itself as mocks
are scored. The free-vs-paid split is driven by the learner's entitlement and only bites when
enforcement is on.

### Billing / entitlements (`/billing`)

One account, one wallet, independently-purchasable per-course entitlements, a multi-exam bundle with a
cross-course discount, and per-course free tiers (BL-01..05, AC-01). Tier is encoded in
`Entitlement.status` (`free` | `active` | `expired`); the SKU catalog, orders, and prediction records
are the only new tables.

| Method + path | Does |
|---|---|
| `GET /billing/catalog` | the SKU catalog: per-course free + paid tiers (USD for GMAT/GRE, INR for CAT) and the GMAT+GRE bundle |
| `GET /billing/entitlements` | the learner's entitlements |
| `GET /billing/access?exam=` | entitlement state + free-tier usage + whether enforcement is on |
| `POST /billing/grant-free` | grant the per-course free tier |
| `POST /billing/purchase` | record a purchase and grant entitlement(s) — bundles grant several at once and report the saving |

**`purchase()` records an order and grants entitlements; it does NOT move money.** A real payment
provider (Stripe for USD, Razorpay for INR) integrates at that one function. This is the
records-and-logic layer the PRD specifies, not a payment integration.

### Enforcement is a toggle

`enforce_entitlements` (env `ENFORCE_ENTITLEMENTS`, default **false**) keeps the demo fully open. When
switched on, `billing.enforce(...)` gates course-scoped surfaces: a paid surface requires an active
entitlement (HTTP 402 otherwise), the free tier is auto-granted for baseline access, and a metered
free-tier resource (e.g. number of full mocks) blocks with 402 once exhausted. The machinery is real
and tested; turning it on is one flag, so no existing flow breaks until you choose.

### Honest limitations

The score-space band is exact for GMAT (total) and CAT (percentile); GRE currently publishes the
native ability range with a note that the panel-aware score band is pending. The accuracy record only
becomes meaningful once real outcomes are fed back via `honesty.record_outcome(...)`. Free-tier limits
beyond `full_mocks` are catalog-data, not yet wired into every surface. No real payment provider is
connected — `purchase()` is the integration seam.

## Real auth, cross-exam warm-start, GMAT/GRE mounted (Phase 6)

Phase 6 puts a real identity layer under the platform, turns the "one account, signals transfer"
thesis into working code, and brings GMAT and GRE online as full course lines.

### Real JWT auth (`/auth`)

Password accounts and HS256 JWTs, **stdlib only** (no new dependencies). Passwords are PBKDF2-HMAC-
SHA256 with a per-user salt; tokens are signed JWTs with the algorithm pinned (alg=none and RS/HS
confusion are rejected) and verified in constant time. All of it lives in `services/security.py`, so
swapping to argon2 + PyJWT for production is a one-file change.

| Method + path | Does |
|---|---|
| `POST /auth/register` | create an account with a password, return a Bearer JWT |
| `POST /auth/login` | verify email + password, return a Bearer JWT (one error message -> no account enumeration) |
| `GET /auth/me` | the authenticated learner |
| `POST /auth/dev-login` | dev convenience (no password), returns a JWT + `learner_id`; disabled when `dev_mode` is off |

`get_current_learner` accepts a **Bearer JWT** first and falls back to the legacy `X-Learner-Id` header
for dev, so every existing flow keeps working. Set `REQUIRE_JWT=true` to disable the legacy header and
make JWT mandatory. **`JWT_SECRET` must be overridden in production** (the default is a dev placeholder).

### Cross-exam warm-start (`/account/warm-start`, AC-02)

A learner's second course starts warmer than cold. Three shared constructs transfer across courses —
**quant core**, **Reading Comprehension**, and the **data-logic engine** (GMAT Data Insights <-> CAT
DILR). When a course is newly entitled, ability measured on those constructs in the learner's other
courses seeds a prior for the new one.

The honesty rule is enforced: a transferred prior is **always provisional** (`is_claim: false`) and its
SE is **inflated** for crossing exams — shown as an estimate to be confirmed, never as established
ability (the Honest Perimeter from Phase 5 does the marking). Warm-start runs automatically when an
entitlement is granted (free or paid), and `GET /account/warm-start?exam=` previews the transfer
without persisting.

### GMAT and GRE mounted

`services/mount.py` seeds the GMAT and GRE exam structures — sections with construct-mappable keys
(QA -> quant, VA -> rc, DI -> data_logic), concepts, and approved items — on boot, idempotently. All
three courses are now live for mocks, diagnosis, billing, and warm-start. (The items are scaffold
samples so the engine runs end-to-end; real GMAT/GRE content is authored per the exam PRDs.)

### Honest limitations

The transfer uses a fixed cross-exam variance penalty (`TRANSFER_VAR`) rather than an empirically
fitted one, and pools cold responses by construct rather than running a full multidimensional model.
The mounted GMAT/GRE items are scaffolds, not authored content. The hand-rolled JWT is correct for
HS256 but production should use a vetted library; the dev `JWT_SECRET` must be replaced.

## Production serving & scale (Phase 8)

The app is built to scale horizontally; this phase makes that real and proves it on actual Postgres.
Two things landed, plus one important bug fix.

**Runs on real Postgres, with a real connection pool.** `DATABASE_URL` swaps the engine; on Postgres
the app now uses a bounded `QueuePool` (`db_pool_size`, `db_max_overflow`, `db_pool_timeout`,
`db_pool_recycle`, all env-tunable). Verified end-to-end against Postgres 16: DDL (`create_all`), JSON
columns, UUID keys, foreign-key enforcement, the full learning write path, and the mock engine.

**Bug fix found only because we tested on Postgres.** The CAT seed inserted `items` before the parent
`knowledge_nodes` they reference. SQLite doesn't enforce foreign keys by default, so it passed silently
— and would have crashed the first real Postgres boot. Fixed the seed ordering, and **turned on SQLite
FK enforcement** (`PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`) so this class of bug now fails loudly in the test suite
instead of in production. All 97 tests pass with FK enforcement on.

**Multi-worker serving behind a load balancer.** Production runs gunicorn supervising uvicorn workers
(`gunicorn_conf.py`) — every CPU core used, crash-resilient (workers respawn), workers recycled
periodically against slow leaks. Because the app is stateless (identity is in the JWT), you also run
many *containers* behind nginx (`docker-compose.prod.yml` + `nginx.conf`) and scale across machines.
Proven: gunicorn with 3 workers on Postgres served 50 concurrent requests cleanly.

```bash
# local: multi-worker against your Postgres
WEB_CONCURRENCY=4 DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://… gunicorn -c gunicorn_conf.py app.main:app

# production: full stack (Postgres + Redis + N app workers + nginx LB)
export JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
export ADMIN_EMAILS="you@yourco.com"
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build --scale app=3
# scale the app tier any time; nginx picks up replicas automatically:
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --scale app=6
```

**The connection budget (the operational rule that keeps it up).** Each worker holds up to
`db_pool_size + db_max_overflow` (default 5 + 10 = 15) Postgres connections. Total at peak ≈
`app_replicas × WEB_CONCURRENCY × 15`. Keep that under Postgres `max_connections` (the prod compose
sets it to 200). Example: 3 replicas × 4 workers × 15 = 180 < 200 ✓. To scale wider than that, add
**pgbouncer** to multiplex (next on the path) rather than just raising `max_connections` forever.

**What this gets you, and what's still ahead.** This is steps 1–2 of the scale path (Postgres +
horizontal serving) — enough to handle everyday concurrent load by adding replicas. The mock-day spike
(tens of thousands starting/submitting at once) still needs the remaining items: move calibration to an
**offline worker** (Redis is wired in compose), **vectorise IRT with numpy**, **Redis-cache** hot
reads, **pgbouncer**, and **async mock-submit scoring**. Then load-test the spike for a real ceiling.

## Admin content portal (Phase 7)

Content authoring now sits behind an admin perimeter — "no outsiders." Before this phase the
`/ingest/*` endpoints had **no auth at all** (anyone who could reach the server could post questions),
and the syllabus graph could only be created in code. Phase 7 closes both gaps.

**The perimeter.** An account is an admin iff its email is in `ADMIN_EMAILS` (env) **or** it has a row
in the additive `admin_users` table. `require_admin` guards every content route: unauthenticated → `401`,
authenticated non-admin → `403`. It accepts **only** a real Bearer JWT (never the legacy passwordless
`X-Learner-Id`), so knowing an admin's account id can't be used to impersonate them. The same guard now
also protects the pre-existing `/ingest/*` upload endpoints.

**Secure bootstrap (no public "make me admin" hole).** Mint the first admin on the server:

```bash
python -m scripts.create_admin you@yourco.com "a-strong-password" "Your Name"
```

It creates/updates the account + password and grants the admin role. After that, that admin can grant
others from the portal (Admins tab) or `POST /admin/admins`. On boot, `ensure_admins()` also promotes any
already-existing accounts whose email is in `ADMIN_EMAILS`.

**The portal** is served at `GET /admin` (`static/admin.html`). It's a login page; all data and actions
behind it require an admin JWT, so opening the URL does nothing without credentials. Four areas:
- **Syllabus** — view/build the graph: exams, sections, topics, concepts, prerequisite edges; delete nodes
  (guarded: a node with child concepts or items can't be deleted until emptied).
- **Questions** — list items (with answers), filter by exam/concept/status, create a single question,
  edit (version bumps), approve, retire, delete.
- **Bulk upload** — drag-drop the question-bank `.xlsx` (same format as the authors' path) → import report.
- **Admins** — list / grant / revoke.

**API (all under `/admin`, all admin-gated).** `GET /admin/me`, `GET /admin/exams`,
`GET /admin/syllabus?exam=`; `POST /admin/exams|sections|topics|concepts|prereqs`,
`DELETE /admin/prereqs`, `DELETE /admin/nodes/{id}`; `GET /admin/items`, `POST /admin/items`,
`PATCH /admin/items/{id}`, `POST /admin/items/{id}/approve|retire`, `DELETE /admin/items/{id}`,
`POST /admin/items/upload-xlsx`; `GET /admin/admins`, `POST /admin/admins`, `DELETE /admin/admins/{id}`.

The single-item create runs through the **same validated ingest path** as bulk upload, so the
authored-vs-derived boundary holds (you still can't author IRT `a`/`b`/`c`). Bulk xlsx remains the
workhorse for volume; the portal is for the graph, approval/QC, and spot-edits. A newly authored +
approved question is immediately served by `/practice/next` — the upload-then-serve loop is closed.

The full five-pass QC review workflow from the PRD is a later phase; today the lifecycle is
draft → approved → retired with `SERVE_ONLY_APPROVED` gating what learners see.

## Notes / deliberate Phase-0 simplifications
- `create_all` instead of Alembic migrations (Alembic arrives when the schema stabilises).
- `Item` is one-row-per-id with version-bump-on-change; immutable versioned rows arrive in
  Phase 2 when calibration makes version binding load-bearing.
- Enum-like fields stored as strings for portability; can become native PG enums later.
- Auth is a stub; real auth is Phase 5.
