"""Gunicorn config for production serving — this is step 2 of the scale path (multiple app workers).

Run it with:   gunicorn -c gunicorn_conf.py app.main:app

Why gunicorn + uvicorn workers: FastAPI is ASGI. One uvicorn process uses ~one CPU core (Python's
GIL). Gunicorn supervises several uvicorn worker processes so the app uses every core on the box and
survives a worker crash (it respawns). The app is stateless (identity is in the JWT), so these
workers are interchangeable and you can also run many *containers* of this behind a load balancer
(see docker-compose.prod.yml + nginx.conf) to scale across machines.

Connection budget (important when going wide): each worker holds up to
(db_pool_size + db_max_overflow) Postgres connections. Total at peak ~= workers x that. Keep it under
Postgres `max_connections` (the prod compose raises it to 200) or put pgbouncer in front.
